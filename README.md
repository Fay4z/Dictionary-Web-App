# Dictionary Web App

This is a simple Dictionary App that gives synonyms and antonyms of a given word.

It is simple to use and has minimalistic design,
code complexity.

#### Note :

This is a react project that uses ```tailwinf CSS``` ,```vite``` instead of  ```create-react-app```.
This does not change any functionality or performance that a ```create-react-app``` uses. Instead, ```vite```
increases performance, rendering time etc...

This project is not completely finished...
